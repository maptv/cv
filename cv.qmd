### Mission

My goal is to lead the next generation of scientists and engineers in building solutions that integrate substantive expertise from diverse fields with machine intelligence.
Through my work, I strive to promote open source software, such as the Quarto publishing system, which I use to build dashboards, presentations, reports, websites, and other digital deliverables.
Overall, I aim to leverage my broad scientific background and technical expertise to help transform the promises of science and technology into a better future for all of humanity.
